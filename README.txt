# Experimental Data

These datasets were used in the study 'About drivers of performance for crop growth model calibration at the within-field scale' from Pasquel D., Taylor J.A., Tisseyre B. and Roux S., this article is currently under revision at European Journal of Agronomy. This folder contains the data used for analyses of the spatial calibration performance on virtual vineyards.

## File Descriptions

Each .Rdata file corresponds to a list object. For each .Rdata file, the first levels of the list correspond to the spatial structure modalities (3 different levels : strong, moderate and weak) ; the second levels of the list correspond to the 40 fields of each spatial structure modalities. Each field is represented by a data.frame with the 49 sites of measurement for each measurement dates (not only the considered in the article).

In the studies, 1080 simulations were considered corresponding to :
40 fields * 3 spatial structure modalities * 3 levels of correlation with the ancillary data * 3 spatial calibration level considered (i.e. field, site scale + the best within-field segmentation)

Here, their is all the segmentations realiazed for the study (so not only the best within-field scale is available here).

For each data.frame, the file structure is as follow :

| Column             | Description                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|

| `N`                | Northern point reference               |
